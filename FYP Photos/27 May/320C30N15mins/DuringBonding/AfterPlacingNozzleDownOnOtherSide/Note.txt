The one thing that I cannot verify is if the delamination already occurred on the underside of the first bond already.
Suspicion now is that the iridescence comes from the fact that some level of bonding has occured on both sides, and placing the weight down on the other side has shifted
the bonds and is starting to break them.
There cannot be delamination of the edge of the pad if no bonding has occured!
Want to try bonding in the middle of a strip and seeing if that reduces this impact.
